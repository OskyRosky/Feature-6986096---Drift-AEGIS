## Current stage
**E7D.11 — Settings & Data Quality Dashboard Content: COMPLETED — VISUALLY ACCEPTED (Oscar, 2026-07-20).**
> **Analytical content only** (navigation shell from E7D.0 replaced). Converted the Settings & Data Quality shell
> (UID `aegis-forecast-drift-settings` **preserved**) into a governed, read-only view of the **18 governed
> data-quality checks** + model parameters. **GATE A PASSED** — the 18 checks are sourced authoritatively from
> `validation/_data_quality_checks.csv` (18 rows, all PASS) + `checks.py`; **none invented, split, merged or
> renamed** (`canonical_check_name` verbatim; category/scope/rule/expected are a documented presentation layer). A
> reproducible generator `V2/scripts/build-e7d11-check-catalog.ps1` derives the machine-readable catalog
> `validation/forecast_drift_data_quality_checks.csv` (SHA-256 `9E76361…551EE1`) and **aborts if ≠ 18**.
> **Serving — Option B (Oscar-authorized 2026-07-20):** a **single** exact-match nginx allowlist rule
> (`location = /forecast_drift_data_quality_checks.csv`) was added (no wildcard, no listing, `location / { return 404; }`
> preserved); `nginx -t` OK; **only aegis-csv restarted** (Grafana not restarted). The catalog is served as a
> **byte-identical copy** in `current/` (same checksum). Endpoint from the Grafana container: **HTTP 200**, 19 lines,
> 18 distinct IDs, 18 PASS, 0 FAIL. The catalog table reads it via **Infinity URL** (not hardcoded, not inline).
> **22 panels:** nav, header, about; KPI row (Data Quality **18/18** green, Checks Passed **18**, Checks Failed **0**,
> Checks Total **18**, Run Status Success), Latest Validation Run, **18-check catalog**, Checks by Category (9 derived
> categories → 18), Governed Weights (20/40/30/10 = 100), Status Thresholds & boundary behavior
> ([0,20)/[20,40)/[40,70)/[70,100]), Computability Coverage (156/168, 168/168, 168/168, 144/168), Non-Computable
> Reasons (NO_REALIZED_OVERLAP 12, INSUFFICIENT_VERSIONS 24), Dataset Inventory (168/672/71/1/18), Data Lineage,
> Governance Rules, Known Limitations, Latest Governed Run — Provenance. All figures reconcile to the governed
> CSVs / `settings.py` with **zero diffs**, verified live via `/api/ds/query`. Published via
> `V2/scripts/push-e7d11-settings-data-quality.ps1` (token **DPAPI in-memory only**) → `success` version 4; E7D.0
> shell archived to `archive/aegis-forecast-drift-settings-shell-e7d11.json`. **No score/weight/threshold/validation
> logic change; no other dashboard touched; no manual commit; R1 unchanged.** Deliverables:
> `engineering/E7_grafana/E7D11_*` (10 docs), rebuilt `aegis-forecast-drift-settings.json`, the two publish/build
> scripts, the governed catalog, and one nginx allowlist line. Token
> **E7D11_SETTINGS_DATA_QUALITY_COMPLETED_VISUALLY_ACCEPTED**. **Oscar visually confirmed** DQ 18/18, catalog
> DQ-01..DQ-18, Checks Passed 18 / Failed 0, working local filters, weights/thresholds/computability/reasons/inventory/
> lineage correct, read-only with no secrets, and no No-data/broken panels. **Carry-over to E7D.12:** verify the
> governed refresh auto-regenerates the `validation/` + `current/` catalog copies (matching SHA-256). **Do not start

**E7D.8 — Historical Timeline MVP (governed chronological view): COMPLETED — VISUALLY ACCEPTED (Oscar, 2026-07-20).**
> Rebuilt the **Historical Timeline** section (uid `aegis-forecast-drift-timeline` **retained**) from the E7D.0
> shell into a **read-only** governed timeline. **Central rule upheld — NO FABRICATED HISTORY.** Each of the
> **71** timeline records is a governed drift event (`is_event = 1`, run 1) positioned by **`forecast_version`** —
> the only governed field with real temporal spread (14 versions in signals, **12 among events**, 2024-04 → 2026-05).
> `detected_on = created_at = changed_at` collapse to a **single** detection instant (2026-07-13 22:38 UTC) → surfaced
> as a fact, **not** 71 clumped rows. Lifecycle = **71 initial `Open`, 0 transitions** → reported verbatim, no invented
> status changes; no invented Forecast Generated / Alert Triggered activity. **Date Range is FUNCTIONAL (the key
> acceptance), proven live via `/api/ds/query`:** All **71** · YTD **40** · Last180d **32** · Last90d **5** ·
> Last60d/30d **0** · 2024 **5** · 2025 **26** · 2026 **40**. Mechanism reverse-engineered via probes 1–7: the Infinity
> backend **ignores the native time range** and cannot do numeric/date casts (`>=`/`<=` only on numbers; no
> `toDate`/`int64`/`startsWith`; `+` concatenates), so raw dates are coerced → the timeline uses `fv_label = 'v'+forecast_version`
> and a **custom `date_range` variable** filtering by `contains('${date_range:raw}', '|' + fv_label + '|')` over pipe-bounded
> version haystacks; **the native time picker is hidden** (would be a dead control). **14 panels:** section nav; header;
> temporal-model note; KPIs Timeline Records **71** / Drift Events **71** / Forecast Versions **12** / Affected Forecast
> Keys **12** / Lifecycle Records **71**; **Historical Timeline** table (drift by forecast_version, newest first, colored
> family+status, wrapped explanation); **Drift Events by Forecast Version** barchart (chronological, sums to 71); **Timeline
> Records by Forecast Key** barchart; **Historical Details** table (Timeline Date, Date Basis, Timeline Type, Forecast Key,
> Region, Previous Version, Drift Family, Drift Score, Drift Status, Lifecycle Status, Explanation, Run ID); **Latest Governed
> Run** (1 · Success · 168 · 71) and **Data Quality** (`18 / 18 checks passed`). **7 data-driven filters:** forecast_key,
> forecast_version (`fv_label`), region, drift_status, run_id, drift_family, **date_range** (custom, default *All available
> history*). **Documented deviations:** native time picker hidden (Infinity can't honor it); **no** Timeline Type dropdown
> (single governed category); filter set adds region+forecast_version+drift_family vs the E7D.0 timeline matrix; **Timeline
> Records == Drift Events (=71)** by construction (stated in both KPI descriptions). **GATES A–F all PASS** (rows/columns/
> distinct counts + the Date Range table above). **Reconciliation 0 discrepancies** (events=events_created=71; per-version
> sum=71; 2024+2025+2026=71; lifecycle 71/0; DQ 18/18). Published **only** the Timeline dashboard via
> `V2/scripts/push-e7d8-timeline.ps1` (token **DPAPI-decrypted in memory only**, never printed) → **v3**, `success`,
> `inFolder`, 14 panels, `keepTime=false`, `includeVars=true`, timezone **UTC**, timepicker hidden; shell archived at

**E7D.7 — Events MVP (governed event log): COMPLETED — VISUALLY ACCEPTED (Oscar, 2026-07-20).**
> **Visually accepted by Oscar (2026-07-20):** Latest Event shows the full row (no clipping);
> Events by Drift Status uses the correct explicit colors (Healthy green / Watch yellow / Warning orange /
> Critical red); data and all other panels working.
> **Visual repair (v5–v6):** (1) **Events by Drift Status** donut now colors each slice with **explicit
> `byName` fixed-color overrides** (Healthy green / Watch yellow / Warning orange / Critical red) instead
> of `palette-classic` (which colored by position and ignored the value mappings); (2) **Latest Event**
> panel kept at `h:4` (a trial `h:3` clipped the single data row) to show Event ID / Event Timestamp
> / Forecast Key / Drift Family / Drift Score / Drift Status without excess space. **No queries, filters, metrics,
> Event Log or other dashboards changed.** KPIs re-verified unchanged (Total **71**, Critical **14**,
> Warning **34**, Affected Forecast Keys **12**, Data Quality **18/18**).
> Transformed the **Events** section (uid `aegis-forecast-drift-events` **retained**) from the E7D.0
> structural shell into a **read-only** operational dashboard over the governed drift-**event** log.
> **Key data finding:** `forecast_drift_event_history.csv` is a **thin** 7-column lifecycle table (all
> `new_status = Open`, single `changed_at`) — **not** the rich event source; the **71 governed events are
> the subset of `forecast_drift_signals.csv` where `is_event = 1`**, which carries every rich field
> (forecast_key, region, dominant_drift_family, forecast_drift_score, drift_status, explanation,
> event_status). **13 panels:** Total Events (**71**), Critical (**14**), Warning (**34**), Affected
> Forecast Keys (**12**); Latest Event; **Events by Drift Family** donut (shape 26 / stability 24 /
> volatility 15 / performance 6, non-severity palette); **Events by Drift Status** donut (Critical 14 /
> Warning 34 / Watch 13 / Healthy 10, severity palette); **Events by Forecast Key** barchart (single
> detection instant → **no over-time trend**); the full **Governed Event Log** (71 rows, newest first,
> native column-filter search, wrapped Explanation); **Latest Governed Run** (1 · Success · 168 · 71) and
> **Data Quality** (18/18). **Read-only by design** — no resolve/ack/close/edit, no invented lifecycle
> states (only governed `event_status = Open` shown verbatim), no invented Severity (`drift_status` is
> the governed band; `severity` alias not surfaced), no invented Service/Scenario/Event Type (empty /
> single-valued / absent in the snapshot). **6 data-driven filters:** forecast_key, forecast_version
> (via `fv_label`), region, drift_status, run_id, **drift_family** (local). *Documented deviation vs the
> E7D.0 filter matrix:* Events **adds** `forecast_version` + `drift_family` because the event rows are the
> `signals` subset where both are native dimensions. **Nothing hardcoded** — 71 derives from
> `is_event = 1`; the mockup's "170 events" is illustrative only, the **CSV is the sole source of truth**.
> **Infinity rule reaffirmed:** every column in a `filterExpression` must be a **selected** column (or
> `computed_columns`); `fv_label = 'v'+forecast_version` requires `forecast_version` to be selected (a
> harness that omitted it returned 0 — the dashboard panels select it → filter returns the correct 5).
> **Reconciliation 0 discrepancies** (KPIs + family/status distributions + affected keys + explanation
> 71/71 + event_status Open + max score 84.72 + run footer + **9 filter scenarios**: All 71, NAM 29,

**E7D.6 — Volatility MVP (analytical panels): COMPLETED — VISUALLY ACCEPTED (Oscar, 2026-07-19).**
> Built the **Volatility** section (uid `aegis-forecast-drift-volatility` **retained**) from the E7D.0 structural
> shell into a full governed analytical dashboard for the volatility drift family (governed weight **10%**).
> **Deliberately NOT a mechanical clone of Stability/Shape** — Volatility is only **partially computable**:
> **13 panels** — **A** Average Volatility Drift Score (**56.04**, bands 20/40/70); **B** Volatility Signals
> Computable (**144**); **D** Volatility Coverage (**85.7 %** = 144 ÷ 168); **E** Maximum Volatility Drift Score
> (**100.00**); **F** Volatility Drift Score over time (**12** `forecast_version` points, UTC — **ignores the

> Score by Forecast Key (**horizontal barchart**, NAM-SDF **82.21** top); **H** Volatility Signal Details
> (per-signal, score desc, Computable Yes/No, full width, shows non-computable rows); **I** Volatility Profile —
> Governed Auxiliary Metrics (from `forecast_drift_family_scores.csv`: `rolling_stddev/cov/mad`,

> (**INSUFFICIENT_VERSIONS = 24**); **K** Latest Governed Run (1 · Success · 2026-07-13 22:44 UTC · 168 · 71);
> **L** Data Quality 18/18. **No value is hardcoded** — every KPI reduces the datasource live. **Scope decisions
> justified by the data:** the **24 non-computable** signals are exactly the first two versions of each of the 12
> keys (`2024-04-01`, `2024-05-01`), governed by `not_computable_reason = INSUFFICIENT_VERSIONS` → a
> **Non-computable Summary panel IS built** (unlike Stability/Shape at 168/168); **Coverage is a first-class KPI**
> (85.7 %, denominator = full filtered universe, dynamic); averages/max **exclude** non-computable signals (never
> zeroed); the governed **auxiliary metrics live in family_scores.csv (not signals.csv)** and are surfaced in a
> dedicated **Volatility Profile** table honoring only `forecast_key` + `forecast_version` (family_scores has no
> region/status/run columns — documented two-table exception); a **ranking barchart** (new panel type) answers the
> key-level dispersion question; the trend starts at the **first computable bucket 2024-06-01**. **Reused the
> stable E7D.1–E7D.5 mechanism verbatim** (`queryType`-wrapped variables, `v`-prefixed `fv_label`, quoted

**E7D.2 — Forecast MVP (analytical panels): COMPLETED — VISUALLY ACCEPTED (2026-07-19).**
> Oscar's first visual review of **v2** found **two mandatory defects** (all other panels confirmed working):

> orange / Critical→red, `color.mode:fixed`), so color is bound to value/series not position; (2) the **Drift
> Score Heatmap rendered empty** (only the Forecast Key column) — **root cause:** the 14-target Infinity pivot
> fired 14 GETs to one URL, Infinity **coalesced responses per URL** so only target A returned data and the
> join left just `forecast_key`. **Fixed** by rebuilding the heatmap as a **single Infinity query** pivoted by

**E7D.1 — Overview MVP (analytical panels): COMPLETED — VISUALLY ACCEPTED (2026-07-19).**
> The first published build (**v3**) rendered **"No data" on every panel** inside Grafana (empty filters)
> even though external `/api/ds/query` tests passed. **Root cause (two defects):** (1) the 5 template
> variables were stored as **flat Infinity queries without the `queryType:"infinity"` wrapper**, so the
> plugin treated them as legacy → empty dropdowns → `${var:singlequote}` → `region IN ()` → backend error on
> every panel; (2) panels 23/24 **aliased a filtered column** (`Forecast Key`/`Run ID`), which the backend
> filter could not resolve (`No parameter 'forecast_key'/'calculation_run_id' found`). **Both fixed** (variable
> wrapper restored; filtered columns' `text`==selector with display headers moved to rename/`displayName`)
> and republished as **v5**. A **second defect** then surfaced: the `forecast_version` variable alone showed a
> red error triangle because Grafana's frontend infers its **ISO-date** option values as a `time` field,
> emptying that variable → `forecast_version IN ()` → all signal panels "No data" again. **Fixed (v6)** by
> filtering on a non-date **`v`-prefixed label** (`fv_label = 'v' + forecast_version`) across the variable and
> 10 signal panels (the trend panel keeps `forecast_version:timestamp` for its X-axis and drops the version
> clause). Broken JSON archived at
> `V2/grafana/dashboards/archive/aegis-forecast-drift-foundation-e7d1-broken.json`. Post-repair **end-to-end
> per-panel replay of the published targets (All-expanded interpolation): 13/13 filter panels PASS, 0 FAIL.**
> Oscar **visually confirmed** the data and numbers, then requested a final **visual polish (v7)** — donut
> severity colors (Healthy green / Watch yellow / Warning orange / Critical red), a 2024-anchored time axis
> (`2024-03-01 → 2026-06-01`, removing the empty 2022 gap), a slimmer nav/header (`h:3→h:2`, no content or
> links removed, panels reflowed), and a corrected filter-semantics note (KPIs/distribution/families/ranking
> honor all five filters; the **trend intentionally ignores Forecast Version** to preserve full history).
> Polish re-validated **13/13 PASS**, data still visible; **Oscar formally accepted**. Do **not** start E7D.2
> until authorized.

Transformed the **Overview** (uid `aegis-forecast-drift-foundation` **retained**) from the E7C/E7D.0
foundation-preview into a complete **governed analytical dashboard** — **7 components / 15 panels** — adapting
the Power BI V1 Overview logic to Grafana + the read-only governed V2 CSV snapshot (**the dashboard does not
cook data**). Components: **A** KPI row (Total Signals **168** · Total Events **71** · Avg Drift **28.8** ·
Critical **14** · Warning **34** · Watch **38** · Healthy **82**); **B** Drift Status donut (82/38/34/14,
severity palette); **C** Avg Drift Score over time (14 `forecast_version` points, dashed thresholds 20/40/70,
UTC); **D** Signals by dominant family (Stability 88 · Volatility 45 · Shape 27 · Performance 8, **neutral**
color); **E** Forecast Keys by drift risk (12 keys, avg desc — **NAM-SDF 42.74** top — with band-colored
Max Drift Status); **F** Latest Governed Run (1 · Success · 2026-07-13 22:44 UTC · 168 · 71); **G** Data
Quality **18 / 18**. All **5 shared filters** bound via a single `filterExpression` (backend parser); the
Infinity date-arithmetic bug **and** the frontend ISO-date variable time-inference were **fixed** by
filtering `forecast_version` through a non-date **`v`-prefixed label** (`fv_label`) and quoting `run_id`
(no Overview question left unanswerable by a CSV limitation). **Analytical reconciliation 21/21, 0
mismatches** via read-only `/api/ds/query`; severity KPIs and family counts each sum to 168. Published via

**encrypted with Windows DPAPI (CurrentUser)** at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AEGIS\secrets\grafana\`
(**outside the repo**) and decrypted **only in process memory** by the launch wrapper,

Deliverables: `engineering/E7_grafana/E7B3_*` (5 docs) + `V2/scripts/*grafana-mcp-token.ps1`.
**Token not revoked** — kept until E7C/E7D complete or expiration. **Open risk R1:** external
auto-commit/push to `origin/main` (fired overnight as `4b7c6cc`, no secrets) — watch, do
not modify. **No blockers for E7B.4.** Next: **E7B.4 — Register MCP in Claude Code +
connectivity smoke test** — **awaiting explicit authorization**.

**E7B.2 — Install Pinned Grafana MCP Server: COMPLETE (2026-07-17).** Installed the
**official** `mcp-grafana` **v0.17.2** binary (windows/amd64) **outside the repo** at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\AEGIS\mcp-grafana\v0.17.2\`, verified integrity (SHA256 `939eb0f4…eb62616`
matched **both** the release page **and** the official `checksums.txt`), and validated it
runs locally (`--version`=0.17.2; `--help` shows stdio + `--disable-write`/tool flags).
Created reproducible **secret-free** scripts in `V2/scripts/` (`install-mcp-grafana.ps1`
idempotent, `verify-mcp-grafana.ps1` read-only, `mcp-grafana-install-manifest.json`).
**No connection to Grafana; no service account; no token; no Claude Code registration;
no `.mcp.json`.** Binary kept out of the repo so R1 cannot publish it; PATH not modified.
Integrity unchanged: Grafana & aegis-csv healthy; V2 168/672/71/1; V1 intact. Token:
**E7B2_MCP_INSTALLATION_COMPLETED**. Deliverables: `engineering/E7_grafana/E7B2_*` (5 docs)
+ `V2/scripts/*`. **Open risk R1:** external auto-commit/push to `origin/main` — watch,
do not modify (fired as `b60f2b9` on the prior E7B.1 corrections). **No blockers for E7B.3.**
Next: **E7B.3 — Service account `aegis-mcp` + token** — **awaiting explicit authorization**.

**E7B.1 — Grafana MCP Connection Preflight: COMPLETE (2026-07-17).** Documentation-only
stage (no runtime mutation): produced six deliverables + status updates, but **nothing
installed, no service account/token, no MCP config**. Determined
the safe, reproducible way to connect Claude Code to Grafana via the official
`mcp-grafana` server (**v0.17.2**, requires Grafana ≥9.0; we have 13.0.1). **Selected
Architecture A:** native binary on the Windows host, **stdio**,
`GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000`, Claude Code **local scope**, token via
`GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_FILE` (git-ignored) — zero impact on `aegis-net`/existing
containers, trivial rollback. Designed least-privilege service account `aegis-mcp`,
secret handling, tool allow-list (`datasource`+`search`/`dashboard` only, `--disable-write`
for reads, write scoped to a single temp smoke dashboard), and the E7B.2–E7B.5 plan.
**Known limitation:** no native Infinity/CSV query tool (CSV read only via Infinity
panel + `run_panel_query`, disabled by default). Integrity unchanged: Grafana & aegis-csv
healthy; V2 168/672/71/1; V1==V2; V1 intact. Token: **E7B1_MCP_PREFLIGHT_COMPLETED**.
Deliverables: `engineering/E7_grafana/E7B1_*` (6 docs). **Open risk R1:** external
auto-commit/push to `origin/main` — watch, do not modify. **No blockers for E7B.2.**
Next: **E7B.2 — Install pinned MCP server** — **awaiting explicit authorization**.

**E7B.0 — Formal Closure of E7A.1 (Infinity Query Gate): COMPLETE (2026-07-17).**
Documentation-and-evidence-only stage (no MCP, no system changes). Formally
registered and closed **E7A.1 — Infinity Functional Query Validation Gate** using
manual evidence from the user's authenticated Grafana session: datasource **Health
check successful**; one Infinity query per dataset (CSV / Backend parser / URL /
Table / GET) returned **168 / 672 / 71 / 1** in the Query Inspector. CSV parsing,
tabular usability, and null/empty tolerance = PASS; explicit per-field Grafana
type hints (Time/Number) **deferred to E7C/E7D** (no auto timestamp→Time claim).
Updated `E7A_validation_results.csv` (V14 DEFERRED→PASS; added V18–V25) and closure
docs. Tokens: E7A.1 = **E7A_INFINITY_QUERY_GATE_COMPLETED**; E7B.0 =
**E7B0_E7A1_FORMAL_CLOSURE_COMPLETED**. Deliverables:
`engineering/E7_grafana/E7A1_infinity_manual_query_evidence.md`,
`engineering/E7_grafana/E7B0_closure_summary.md`. **Open risk R1:** external
auto-commit/push to `origin/main` (commits `add`) still active — detected/reported
only. Next: **E7B.1 — MCP Preflight** — **awaiting explicit authorization**.

**E7A.2 — V2 Governed Data Snapshot & Datasource Rewire: COMPLETE (2026-07-17).**
V2 is now a **self-contained Grafana product**. Created a byte-equivalent,
SHA256-verified governed snapshot of the four V1 datasets (+ metadata +
validation) under `V2/data/processed/`, plus an idempotent sync script
`V2/scripts/sync-governed-data.ps1` (allow-list copy, count + hash validation,
manifest `data_manifest.json`, no secrets). Rewired **only** the `aegis-csv` bind
mount from `V1/data/processed/current/` to `V2/data/processed/current/`
(read-only), keeping container name, `aegis-net`, `http://aegis-csv`, datasource
uid `aegis-forecast-drift-csv`, the Grafana container, volume, and port 3000
unchanged. Restarted only `aegis-csv`. Validated: mount RW=false on V2; 4 CSVs
served (**168 / 672 / 71 / 1**); V1==V2 hashes match; Grafana healthy (13.0.1) and
reaches `http://aegis-csv`; Infinity + datasource intact; `V1/data` clean; no
secrets. Token: E7A2_V2_DATA_SNAPSHOT_COMPLETED. Deliverables in
`engineering/E7_grafana/E7A2_*`. Next: **E7B — MCP connection** — **awaiting explicit
authorization**.

**E7A — Grafana Readiness & Data Source: COMPLETE (2026-07-16).** The existing
local Grafana (Enterprise **13.0.1**, container `grafana`, port 3000, volume
`grafana-storage`) was **preserved** (not recreated). Added a read-only CSV HTTP
server `aegis-csv` (nginx:1.27-alpine) under `V2/`, serving the four governed
CSVs from `V1/data/processed/current/` on an internal `aegis-net` network (no host
port). Installed **Infinity 3.10.1** into Grafana and provisioned datasource
**`AEGIS Forecast Drift CSV`** (uid `aegis-forecast-drift-csv`). Validated: Grafana
healthy; Infinity registered; datasource provisioned; all four CSVs reachable by
DNS with exact counts **168 / 672 / 71 / 1**; `text/csv`; mount read-only; datasets
and secrets untouched; volume backed up outside the repo. Token:
E7A_READINESS_DATASOURCE_COMPLETED. Deliverables in `engineering/E7_grafana/`.
Next: **E7B — MCP connection** (service account + token + `mcp-grafana`) — **awaiting
explicit authorization**; no dashboards, service accounts, or MCP created yet.

**E6 — Power BI MVP (local, consume-only): PARTIAL.** Governed semantic model
`AEGIS_Forecast_Drift` authored via Power BI MCP over `V1/data/processed/current/`:
5 tables, shared `DriftDataFolder` parameter, **4 active relationships** (incl.
Calendar), 24 presentation-only measures (no DAX business logic), exported +
corrected to importable TMDL (`V1/PBI/tmdl/`; re-import validated: 5 tables / 24
measures / 4 rels). Official file `V1/PBI/AEGIS_Forecast_Drift.pbix`. **Real Full
refresh executed in the running Desktop and validated in-model** (DAX):
signals 168 / family 672 / events 71 / runs 1 (Calendar 1096), 24 measures
compile with values identical to Python (status 14/34/38/82, deep, 18/18, True),
4 active relationships. 11 pages + AEGIS sidebar specified. Remaining: **save the
`.pbix`** and author the visual pages + sidebar. Token: E6_POWER_BI_MVP_PARTIAL
(stays PARTIAL until visuals are built). Next: build visuals (V1 Power BI only).
